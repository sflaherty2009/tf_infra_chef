# Terraform Chef and Automate Deployment (Azure)

## Overview
This Terraform template is designed to deploy a Chef and Automate environment in Azure. The configuration includes creating resource groups, public IPs, network interfaces, and virtual machines for both Chef and Automate. Additionally, it includes specific provisioning steps to set up and configure Chef and Automate instances.

## Prerequisites
- Terraform installed and configured
- Azure account and credentials
- An existing Azure Virtual Network and subnet
- SSH keys for secure access to the VMs

## Configuration Variables
Ensure the following variables are set in your Terraform configuration:

- `chef_resource_group_name`: Name for the Chef resource group
- `auto_resource_group_name`: Name for the Automate resource group
- `location`: Azure region for deploying resources
- `chef_computer_name`, `auto_computer_name`: Names for the Chef and Automate VMs
- `subnet_id`: ID of the subnet where VMs will be connected
- `vm_size`: Size of the Azure VM
- `publisher`, `offer`, `sku`, `version`: Azure MarketPlace Image details for the VM
- `chef_admin_user`, `auto_admin_user`: Admin usernames for Chef and Automate VMs
- `chef_admin_password`, `auto_admin_password`: Admin passwords for Chef and Automate VMs

## Deployment Steps
1. **Initialize Terraform**: Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. **Plan the Deployment**: Execute `terraform plan` to review the actions Terraform will perform.
3. **Apply the Configuration**: Run `terraform apply` to apply the configuration and create the resources.

## Resource Groups
Two resource groups are created:
1. `azurerm_resource_group.chef`: For Chef resources
2. `azurerm_resource_group.automate`: For Automate resources

## Public IPs and Network Interfaces
Public IPs and network interfaces are created for both Chef and Automate, allowing external access.

## Virtual Machines
Azure VMs are created for Chef and Automate with specified size, image, and storage configurations.

## Provisioners
- **File Provisioners**: Used to transfer configuration files to the VMs.
- **Remote-exec Provisioners**: Execute commands on the VMs to install and configure Chef and Automate, including package installation, cloning cookbooks, and running Chef-solo.

## Security Considerations
- Ensure that the SSH keys used are secured and access is limited.
- Review and manage the admin passwords set for VMs.
- Consider implementing additional network security measures like Network Security Groups (NSGs).

## Maintenance and Updates
Regularly check for updates to the Chef and Automate software and apply updates as necessary. Also, monitor Azure and Terraform for any relevant updates or changes in best practices.

## Troubleshooting
- Verify all prerequisites are met before deployment.
- Use Terraform's detailed error messages to identify and resolve issues.
- Ensure network connectivity and correct subnet configurations.
